# Cross-Chain Dungeon

A Katana appchain example that **settles to a real Starknet network** (Sepolia by
default, **mainnet supported** via `SETTLEMENT_NETWORK`) and **depends
on an external settlement-layer contract (USDC)**. It's a push-your-luck dungeon
roguelite with a **two-token economy**: buy **GAME** with USDC and spend it to enter,
descend with **one appchain transaction per action**, collect **GOLD**, and either
**extract** (bank the run's gold into your on-L2 vault) or **die** (forfeit the
in-progress haul). Then **bank once** — withdraw the whole vault to Sepolia, where
GOLD is minted on L1. The point: appchain value is provisional until you commit it
to the settlement layer.

It's the sibling of [`../cross-chain-game`](../cross-chain-game). Where that demo
runs two local Katanas, this one runs **one** (the appchain) and settles to a real
public chain — and adds a token economy on top of an external contract.

## What's different from cross-chain-game

| | cross-chain-game | **cross-chain-dungeon** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settlement layer | local Katana (`SN_SEPOLIA`) | **real Starknet (Sepolia default, mainnet supported)** |
| Local nodes | 2 Katanas | **1** (appchain only) |
| Economy | none | **two tokens: GAME (USDC→play) + GOLD (winnings, minted on bank)** |
| External dependency | — | **Circle USDC on Sepolia** |
| Gameplay | one roll | **a dungeon run, one tx per action; vault many runs, bank once** |
| Ports | 5050/5051/8081/8082/3001 | **5070/8091/8092/3002** |
| Controller | both chains | **Sepolia only** |

## Prerequisites

This is *not* fully one-click — settling to a real chain needs real accounts.

1. **katana** built from this repo: `( cd ../../ && cargo build --release )`.
2. **Patched saya v0.4.0** (`saya-ops`, `saya-tee`) on PATH — the Poseidon L1→L2
   hash fix. See [`../cross-chain-game/saya-patch`](../cross-chain-game/saya-patch).
3. **Dojo toolchain** (`sozo`/`torii`/`scarb`) via `asdf install` (pinned in
   `.tool-versions`), and a sibling **dojo** checkout (the cairo packages depend on
   it by path, ref `sozo/v1.8.7`).
4. **Bun**.
5. A funded Sepolia **operator** account and a separate funded **saya** account,
   and a **USDC** address — all in `.env` (see below).

## Run it

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # fill in SEPOLIA_RPC_URL, operator + saya accounts, USDC
./up.sh                  # appchain :5070, saya → Sepolia, torii ×2, frontend :3002
```

`up.sh` deploys the mock TEE registry + piltover core on Sepolia, starts the
appchain and saya, deploys the economy + worlds (`scripts/deploy.ts`), starts both
Torii indexers, and serves the client. `./down.sh` stops the local processes.

Then open `http://localhost:3002`, **Dev-mint** some GAME (or **Buy** it with
USDC), start a **New Game** (each dive is its own run — you can keep several open and
continue any of them from the lobby), play, **Extract** to bank gold into your vault,
then on the **Bank** tab withdraw the vault to Sepolia to mint **GOLD**.

## Funding & costs

Every deploy and every `saya update_state` is a **real Sepolia transaction**:

- The **operator** pays for the TEE registry, piltover, the GAME/GOLD/sale/entry
  contracts, and the bank-world migration.
- **saya** pays for `update_state` on every settled batch (recurring) — give it a
  **dedicated** funded account, never shared with the operator (nonce contention
  stalls settlement).
- The **player** path: `Dev-mint` needs only Sepolia gas (no USDC); `Buy` needs
  real test **USDC**. The dev-mint faucet exists so the demo is playable without it.

## Using Controller (optional)

By default the client signs Sepolia transactions with the **operator account** (a
real funded account from `deployments.json`) — no login. The header **login**
button can swap in a [Cartridge Controller](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/controller)
instead. Unlike cross-chain-game, the Controller here only ever touches **Sepolia**
(a network the hosted keychain knows), so there's no chain-switching — the appchain
play actions always use the local dev account. Passkey login needs trusted HTTPS;
`CONTROLLER=1 ./up.sh` serves the app at `https://localhost:3002` via `mkcert`.
